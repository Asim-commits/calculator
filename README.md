# calculator

Wanted to make a GUI calculator since i started to learn coding (which was several years back hahaha). 
Checklist: 
a) Should perform basic and some additional mathematical operations. 
b) Don't procrastinate too much on making the calculator beautiful. It should look just fine. 
c) Add colors to different buttons.
